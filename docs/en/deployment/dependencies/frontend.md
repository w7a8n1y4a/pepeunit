# Frontend

## Frontend in a broad sense

`Frontend in a broad sense` is a set of `2` services: `Frontend` and [Grafana](/en/deployment/dependencies/grafana). Together, these services provide interaction between [Users](/en/development-pepeunit/mechanics/roles.html#user) and the [Backend](/en/deployment/dependencies/backend).

## Frontend service

The `Frontend service` is a publicly available application intended to provide [Users](/en/development-pepeunit/mechanics/roles.html#user) with interaction with the [Backend](/en/deployment/dependencies/backend) through a graphical user interface. It interacts with the [Backend](/en/deployment/dependencies/backend) using:
- [REST](/en/definitions#rest)
- [GQL](/en/definitions#gql)
