# Prometheus

`Prometheus` is an open-source monitoring and alerting system designed for collecting, storing and analyzing time-series metrics.

::::info
In [Pepeunit](/en/conception/overview), `Prometheus` is used to aggregate [Monitoring](/en/deployment/monitoring) data from the following services:
- [Prometheus](/en/deployment/dependencies/prometheus)
- [Backend](/en/deployment/dependencies/backend)
- [EMQX](/en/deployment/dependencies/emqx)
- [Logporter](/en/deployment/dependencies/logporter)

The ultimate purpose of using Prometheus in [Pepeunit](/en/conception/overview) is to provide data for [Grafana](/en/deployment/dependencies/grafana).
