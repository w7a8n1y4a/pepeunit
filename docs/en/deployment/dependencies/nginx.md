# Nginx

`Nginx` is a high-performance open-source web server that can act as an `API Gateway`, load balancer, reverse proxy and `HTTP` cache for applications and other servers.

::::info
In [Pepeunit](/en/conception/overview), `Nginx` acts as an `API Gateway` – a service that provides a unified [API](/en/definitions#api) interface for all agents to access [Frontend](/en/deployment/dependencies/frontend), [Backend](/en/deployment/dependencies/backend) and [Grafana](/en/deployment/dependencies/grafana).

All [REST](/en/definitions#rest) and [GQL](/en/definitions#gql) requests to [Pepeunit](/en/conception/overview) initially pass through `Nginx`.
