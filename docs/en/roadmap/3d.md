# 3D Design System for Models

Designed with resin (photopolymer) printers in mind

1. Reusable power mount format for USB-C
1. Dovetail joints for connecting blocks to each other
1. Size grid / standard form factors
1. Dovetail locking mechanisms
1. Detachable connections without dovetails
1. Detachable dovetails, similar to DIN rails or some other solution to be designed
1. Standard wire pass-through holes
1. Standard ventilation / cooling grilles
1. Standard rounded edges (fillets)
1. Petal / lobe design style
1. Standard spring guides so that covers snap-fit by friction
1. Standard countersunk holes for M3 and M4 screws to secure components
1. Standard friction-mount frames — grooves along the edges of rectangles/squares
1. Standard through-holes for carrying blocks on keyrings, lanyards, etc.

## Frame Enclosures

A rigid frame that wraps around a PCB while providing openings for wires.

The main idea is to have surfaces for laying glass panels and/or filling the spaces with epoxy/silicone. Such enclosures would be waterproof/dustproof, anti-vibration, or impact-resistant.

Half-frames, bent frames, or other shapes can be made.

To secure PCBs, a clamp with a threaded stud needs to be designed — it should be tweezers-type, preferably with parallel-sliding jaws.

Frames can include openings for USB-C and any other elements of the design system.

For connectors, openings should account for the direction of cable insertion.
