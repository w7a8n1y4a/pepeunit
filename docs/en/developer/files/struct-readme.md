# readme.md

[readme.md](/en/definitions#readme-md) is the documentation for a [Unit](/en/definitions#unit) and the most important file in any repository. How easy it is for other people to use a [Unit](/en/definitions#unit) depends directly on how complete and clear this file is.

::::tip
To keep [Unit](/en/definitions#unit) documentation consistent, every [Pepeunit](/en/conception/overview) instance provides a [readme.md](/en/definitions#readme-md) generator based on [pepeunit.toml](/en/definitions#pepeunit-toml). The generator converts machine-readable [pepeunit.toml](/en/definitions#pepeunit-toml) into a human-readable [readme.md](/en/definitions#readme-md).

## Generating readme.md

::::info
To find the generator, click your nickname in the top‑right corner, then click the `Generate README.md` button. You will be prompted to select a [pepeunit.toml](/en/definitions#pepeunit-toml) file. Once you confirm the file, [readme.md](/en/definitions#readme-md) will be generated and downloaded automatically.
